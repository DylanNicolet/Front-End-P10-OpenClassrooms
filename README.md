<h3 align="center">An apartment rental website</h3>
<img src="./README-images/overview.png"></h1>

>## **In a few words**
This website coded in React will allow users to explore apartments from our database, read about their attributes and view images of said apartements.

>## **Developement technologies used**
* Create React App for the front-end
* React Router for navigation through the site
* SASS for styling
* No React external libraries should be used

>## **Key requirements for the project and a visual of the live results**
1. The photo gallery component should cycle thought the images indefinitly where clicking the next button on the last image will bring us to the first image and vis-versa.
